### Introduction:
A tutorial on how to use [Duniya Skapare](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare) plugin. This is a simple Godot plugin that helps to create 3D worlds using procedural algorithms. Here I show you how to use [Duniya Skapare's](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare) Wave Function Collapse to generate 3D worlds. Watch my [Video]() to understand how the plugin works.

## Prerequisites
#### Godot Game Engine
Godot version **v4.1.3.stable.mono.official [f06b6836a]** and above should work. Previous Godot 4 versions should work but those have not been tested.
***
## Stable Build
[Stable Build - main](https://github.com/deadlykam/Tutorial_Duniya_Skapare) is the stable version of the tutorial and is similar to the one shown in the [Video]().
